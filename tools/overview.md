# Tools We Use

## Philosophy
We *try* to choose tools which minimize the time we need to spend doing a task, including developing tools! Where possible, we'll use common industry tools, but we don't shy away from building our own if necessary for some reason.

All the tools we build are open source by default. You can find them at the following places:
