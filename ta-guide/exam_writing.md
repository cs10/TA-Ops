# Exam Writing

Again, we must ask ourselves, what are we trying to accomplish as educators?

## Question Writing

## Rubric Making (Generic)
> Note, read the [Gradescope][TODO] section as well!

Rubrics come in all kinds of forms, but there are two basic kinds.

* Matrix Rubrics
	* These are fairly typical for essays in the US. In these rubrics you have a set of evaluation metrics, and each metric can have some number of distinct items.
	* Typically, a student is evaluated on every "row" of the rubric, so they should get feedback for each metric that's been setup.
	* Instructure's Canvas (bCourses) has a [good example][matrix-rubric] of these. 
* Checkoff Rubrics
	* Check Off rubrics can be seen as a simplification of the matrix type. In this model, you have a set of items, which you either "turn on" or off for each student.
	* You can achieve the exact same effect as a matrix, by making each cell a checkbox. Then you only select 1 checkbox from each 'row'.
	* Gradescope is a [good example][gs-rubirc] of of this kind of rubric. 

Note that while you can accomplish the same grading with both styles, the systems you use will have certain usability concerns and you'll want to keep those in mind. Generally, this doesn't make a big difference, but a checkbox based rubric that has 50 items can be far more complex to interpret than a 10x5 grid.

Goals:
* Rubric items give students a direct assessment of how they did
* Rubrics give students a way to learn from mistakes. 

What you should do:

1. When possible use "positive scoring". That is, the items of the rubric should _add_ to total score for the question, not take points away.
	* This feels more rewarding than punishment.
	* Sometimes additive rubrics can be harder to make than subtractive ones, because it forces you to think about distinct components rather than what students get wrong. By planning this in advance you get a more fair rubric.
2. Each component of the question you be tied to a specific rubric item (or row). A vague rubric doesn't help students learn.
3. Rubric answers should be as detailed as is reasonable. That is, they should include the correct answer or some
