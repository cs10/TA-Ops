# Culture of BJC

We believe that BJC and CS10 have a unique set of "cultural" beliefs that make the course what it is. Of course, these are _not_ gospel; they can change. However, the goal is to set up an environment where we can help students explore a new subject without some of the burdens that come with a required course.
